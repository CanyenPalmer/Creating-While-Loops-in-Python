## Conclusion
* Iterative statements play a major role in automating processes that need to be repeated.
* `while` loops allow you to repeat a process until a specific condition is no longer true.
* Comparison operators can be used to check one value against another.
* Variables can be set as counters and incremented by different amounts to help control your `while` loop.
